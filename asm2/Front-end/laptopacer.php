<h1>Review for Laptop</h1>
<p>If you are a beginner to using a laptop, or simply want a laptop that is affordable and good for work. Today I would like to introduce to you a laptop named Acer Aspire 3 A315 that owns its unbelievably good gadgets.
1. Design
The Aspire 3 A315 inherits the design language of the 2018 Aspire line with a black back cover made of metal that feels luxurious. In addition, the palm rest is made of metal, the bottom and the bottom of the screen uses plastic material to save costs.
<br>
This laptop is 19.9 mm thick and weighs about 1.7 kg, just thin and light enough for you to easily take with you to go out, go to school, to work, ...
<br>
In addition, the Acer Aspire 3 A315 also owns a flexible hinge that opens up to 180 degrees, flexible for you to use in any
<br>
Regarding the connection port, Aspire 3 A315 is fully equipped with the current popular ports, to meet your needs.
<br>
The left side of the device is the charging port, LAN port, HDMI port, USB 3.1 port, USB 3.0 port and 3.5mm headphone port.
<br>
The right side is 'more modest' with only a single USB 3.1 port.
<br>
2. Screen
Our Acer Aspire 3 A315 has a 15.6-inch screen with Full HD resolution. Thanks to the thin screen border design following the current trend, our laptop looks more eye-catching and trendy.
<br>
After a week of using this laptop, I rated the screen of Aspire 3 A315 with sharp resolution, vivid colors, good brightness and high contrast. The anti-glare level is average, which means this machine will be suitable when you work in offices or places with moderate light intensity and not too harsh.
<br>
3. Keyboard and touchpad
The keyboard on my Aspire 3 A315 is quite good, the surface is rough, the keys are shallow, and the bounce is not high, so the new users will need to take some time to get used to. Once we have adapted it, you will type faster and more comfortably.
<br>
And the touchpad on the machine has a large size, a surface made of metal, for a smooth hand feeling and the mouse pointer above also works fast and accurately according to each of your actions below.
<br>
4. Configuration and performance
The Acer Aspire 3 A315 I am using to evaluate has the following summary configuration:
<br>
CPU: Intel Core i5 8265U
RAM: 4 GB
Hard drive: SSD 256 GB
Integrated graphics card: Intel UHD Graphics 620
First I will check the performance score of the device with Geekbench software, the device will gain 22,672 points. A figure is also quite high and stable with the current configuration of Aspire 3 A315.
<br>
Next, I will test the read and write speed of the SSD hard drive on the machine, I found that this hard drive has a maximum reading speed of up to 1,500 MB / s and a write speed of 900 MB / s. Thanks to that, the computer boots up and opens the software quickly.
<br>
In fact, when I used it, I found that the machine boots quickly, the application opens in just a few seconds to complete. Use with office software such as Word, Excel, ... the machine runs fast and smooth.
<br>
In addition, I also tried playing League of Legends games on the machine at a high average configuration, the average FPS is above 6x, smooth and lag-free. But when I turned the screen, the quality of FPS when playing will decrease quite a bit, hope you understand.
<br>
Video test LOL on Acer Aspire 3 A315
With a machine without a discrete graphics card like Acer Aspire 3 A315 that can play games smoothly at a high configuration, it can completely meet the light entertainment needs of you. We can choose Pikachu or dinosaurs to play after stressful working moments.
<br>
5. Heat dissipation
The Acer Aspire 3 A315 has a cooling fan with a single heat sink at the back. The design of the air intake and heat sink section is also quite large, bringing better heat dissipation to the machine.
<br>
In fact, after 3 hours of continuous use, the average temperature of the device is only about 40 degrees Celsius, which means the machine is very lost and this proves that the heat dissipation of the machine works well.
<br>
6. Battery life
As usual, when testing battery life, I set the maximum screen brightness, 50% speakerphone, wifi continuously open, the device used to combine multiple office tasks: writing documents, surfing the web, listening to music , ... The battery life of the device I measured, calculated, and combined with Batterymon software is 6 hours 32 minutes.
<br>
With more than 6 hours of continuous use, the battery life of the Acer Aspire 3 A315 is quite average, can meet the needs of a day of use to work on your office.</p>
